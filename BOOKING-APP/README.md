# GO_TUTORIAL: Booking App

This project is a simple **command-line booking application** built in Go, based on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyUHQIec83I) by **TechWorld with Nana**. It simulates a basic user interface where customers can book conference tickets, demonstrating core Go concepts along the way.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- CLI user interaction (input/output)
- Input validation (strings, numbers, and ranges)
- Data structures: slices and maps
- Functions and packages
- Goroutines for concurrency
- WaitGroups for synchronization
- Modular code organization

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

> A full breakdown is available in [my Go Learning Notes (Google Doc)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V3HW1WOGMZQXHMyMsLmb9Z8JINd3WjsZ69n6wrYziPU/edit?usp=sharing)  
> *(Feel free to make a copy if you're also learning Go!)*

Key takeaways from this project:

- **Go Syntax & Structure**: How Go organizes code, defines variables, and manages scope.
- **Concurrency**: Using goroutines and wait groups to handle tasks in parallel.
- **User Input Handling**: Safely collecting and validating user input in a CLI environment.
- **Best Practices**: Keeping functions small, naming conventions, modular code layout.
