# GO_TUTORIAL

This repository contains my personal Go language projects and experiments as I learn the language.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

- [`BOOKING-APP`](./BOOKING-APP) â€” A beginner-friendly CLI app for booking conference tickets, built by following [TechWorld with Nanaâ€™s Go tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyUHQIec83I). Includes concurrency with goroutines, input validation, and modular structure.

More projects to come as I explore Go further.
